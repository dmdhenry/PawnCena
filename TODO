- Make a simple UI!!! Very necessary for debugging!

- Improve efficiency to allow for deeper searches
    - Save pinned pieces on update_move to have O(1) pinned piece checking! (Reduces redundancy) 

    - Pinned piece and shit needs to be wayyyy fucking faster

- Board heuristic scorer (score positions based on heuristics, no pruning)

- Hardcode in some openings

- Improve heurisitic scoring
